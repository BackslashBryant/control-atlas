# Control Atlas Backlog

- **Owner:** Product owner
- **Status:** Canonical open work only
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-14
- **Supersession:** Add, close, or reprioritize items here; do not create another backlog or preserve completed rows.

| ID | Open outcome | Owner | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXT-A11Y-001 | Hands-on NVDA plus VoiceOver or TalkBack verification | Human QA | Before any claim of assistive-technology conformance |
| EXT-DEVICE-001 | Physical iOS and Android phone verification | Human QA | Before any claim of physical-device coverage |
| EXT-SEC-001 | Independent penetration test | Product owner | Before a formal external security-assurance claim |

Routine dependency, source-freshness, CI, Pages smoke, and comparative performance checks are operations, not backlog items.

## Detail and polish audit

Evidence labels below are deliberate: `live` means the canonical Pages site was inspected, `phone photo` means the supplied Android Chrome capture, and `static` means the current component or stylesheet contract was inspected. Re-test every responsive item at 320, 375, 390, 768, 1024, and 1440 pixels before closure.

| ID | Priority | Open outcome | Evidence | Acceptance criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POLISH-007 | P1 | Close the legacy public-URL trap that led users to the obsolete `ashbryant.github.io/control-atlas/` release. | Both supplied phone photos show the legacy host; a current direct check returns GitHub Pages 404 while the canonical product is on `backslashbryant.github.io/control-atlas/`. The authenticated `BackslashBryant` account has no `ashbryant/control-atlas` repository to configure. | Keep the automated owned-link check that forbids the exact obsolete URL. If the legacy account or Pages property becomes available, publish a minimal canonical redirect; otherwise retain this external ownership limitation explicitly rather than representing the 404 as fixed. |
| POLISH-028 | P2 | Remove duplicate return controls from Resource detail and preserve the user's Resources workspace. | `static`: `OrbitalContextBar` renders `All resources` for `commons-detail` while `CommonsDetailPage` renders a second body-level `Back` link; both reset to the Resources landing state. This repeats the Source-detail navigation defect in a neighboring template. | Keep one truthful context-bar return action, preserve the prior Resources query/collection/owner/type/view state when the detail was opened from a filtered workspace, retain a governed 44 px target, and assert one return control plus Back/Forward restoration at 320/375/390/768/1024/1440. |

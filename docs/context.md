# Control Atlas Context Handoff

## Product Identity

- Public product name: **Control Atlas**
- Campaign line: **Ctrl+Alt+Comply**
- Tagline: **The public map for federal cyber compliance.**
- Supporting line: Open-source reference workbench for mapping controls, tracing frameworks, and generating starter RMF/ATO templates - no login, no evidence upload, no organizational data required.
- Design principle: **Build for translation, not complexity.** See [`docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`](DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md).

## Current Objective

**V1.0 publication decision** — release verification and source-polish reconciliation are complete on deployed `main`; hold the verified candidate without creating or publishing `v1.0.0` until the owner explicitly approves that action.

**Active sprint:** v1.0 release finalization — verification complete; see [`docs/Plan.md`](Plan.md), [`docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`](PRODUCTION_READINESS.md), and the dated [finalization audit](audits/v1-release-finalization-2026-07-17.md).

## Shipped on `main` (do not re-plan)

- Epics 0-10 baseline through Map Foundation v4.0 (see Plan.md epic table)
- **SPR-20260708 remediation:** deferred graph on Explore, sharded `library-search-manifest` + per-catalog shards, `bootstrap-payload` / `load-resilience` E2E, home About/Sources trust row, header search draft clear, Compare coverage chips, mobile overflow fixes, live Pages smoke workflow (`.github/workflows/pages-live-smoke.yml`), federated search shard refresh on lazy load, connections-only filter triggers on-demand graph
- **Newbie-Reframe Phase 7:** 40 official artifacts, 11 supporting tools, 12 companions, FedRAMP rules `2026.07.14.01`, 27 indexed legacy downloads, ten explicit legacy-to-current transitions, and official-workbook FedRAMP baseline ingestion

## Adopted Baseline

- React shell in `src/ui/App.tsx` is the active UI; legacy `src/app/app.mjs` is not mounted
- Build-time importers and `data/generated/*` bundles are the runtime contract
- Library search loads `library-search-manifest.json` + eager shards first; remaining catalog shards lazy-load with UI refresh via `librarySearchRevision`
- Atlas record views load a compact node index and one deterministic incident-edge shard; they do not load the monolithic graph artifacts
- Atlas defaults to a semantic DOM Path, offers a bounded real-edge Map, and keeps List as an equal accessible view; desktop progression is horizontal and mobile progression is vertical
- React Flow and ELK remain lazy for other legacy bounded relationship diagrams, not the primary Atlas route
- Control Atlas is the active repo and deployment identity

## Product Boundary

Control Atlas is public-data-only and has no backend. It may normalize public sources at build time, serve static bundles from GitHub Pages, and generate blank/public-reference exports locally in the browser.

It must not ingest evidence, accept uploads, connect to operational systems, store user, organization, or system data, score compliance, track real assets or packages, or require login.

## Next

1. Owner reviews the finalization evidence and decides whether to accept the documented human screen-reader and real-device residuals
2. Create/publish `v1.0.0` only after a new, explicit owner approval for that final action
3. Keep Node runtime notices and install-fallback cleanup in separate maintenance work

## Status Docs

Canonical delivery state lives in [`docs/Plan.md`](Plan.md). Open PRD gaps only in [`docs/plans/prd-v3-alignment-backlog.md`](plans/prd-v3-alignment-backlog.md).

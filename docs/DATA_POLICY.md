# Control Atlas Data and Publisher-Structure Policy

- **Owner:** Forge and Sentinel
- **Status:** Canonical
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-11
- **Supersession:** Approved source or schema changes update this document, schemas, migration code, and reconciliation tests together.

## Boundary

Control Atlas ingests only lawfully usable public material. It does not accept user, organization, system, asset, scan, finding, or evidence data. Importers run at build time; the browser consumes deterministic static bundles.

Use discovery in this order: official documented API, stable official JSON, official page data, official download artifact, and explicitly invoked rendered discovery last. Required-fresh work may not silently fall back to stale data.

Every included source records owner, version, canonical URL, access status, lifecycle, use or license notes, retrieval method, provenance, checksum, byte length, and actual record count where available. Unknown upstream facts are `null` with a reason, never estimates.

## Containment versus relationships

Each publication has one `CatalogStructureProfile` in `src/shared/catalog-structure.mjs`. Every record has exactly one acyclic containment path rooted in its own publication. Examples:

- DISA STIG: catalog → benchmark → V-ID.
- MITRE ATT&CK: catalog → tactic → technique → sub-technique.
- NIST SP 800-53: catalog → family → control → enhancement.
- NIST SP 800-53A: catalog → family → assessment procedure.

Containment is publisher-native ownership only. Baselines, applicability, assessment targets, CCIs, crosswalks, mappings, references, implementation aids, evidence expectations, and Control Atlas organization remain typed relationships. They cannot supply `parent`, `ancestors`, structural level, or depth.

Four relationship classes remain distinct:

- `structural`: publisher containment; the only class used for breadcrumbs.
- `applicability`: selections, baselines, and overlays.
- `correlation`: mappings, assessments, implementations, references, and crosswalks.
- `organizing`: Control Atlas editorial navigation above publications.

Official published relationships are visually and semantically distinct from inferred suggestions or editorial guidance.

## Source presentation

Publisher strings remain untouched. `StructuredContentBlock` stores presentation-only offsets for paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, and exact code or configuration. Explicit upstream markup wins. Deterministic detection is permitted only at high confidence; ambiguity stays prose. Copy operations use the exact source slice, not visually reconstructed text.

## Reconciliation gates

Builds fail on invalid or abbreviated checksums, byte or record-count disagreement, missing discovery artifacts, duplicate releases or canonical IDs, missing or duplicate containment parents, cycles, undeclared levels, foreign-catalog ancestors, invalid structured-content offsets, or relationship edges appearing in ancestry. `verify:discovery`, `verify:manifests`, AJV internal-schema validation, and the independent NIST OSCAL check remain separate scopes.
